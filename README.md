Impact of Resuscitation code Assignment in the ICU

## What and Why  
Correlation and Descriptive studies.

Problem Definition: Investigating resuscitation code assignment in the intensive care unit is pertinent because revenue is lost in assigning resources to unnecessary resuscitation attempts, especially in cases where do not resuscitate orders have already been procured. Most Patients come to ICU care after a sudden change in health, not planned. Resuscitation code status generally assigned as Full code (FC), until full prognosis done and patients full wishes Â from patient or family are known. This is not easy ! Even in AD (advanced directives) cases, difficult to predict whether stabilization will occur, consequently less aggressive code assignment usually doesn`t occur until after entry into the ICU. For patients who transitioned from FC status, to DNR, or to CMO, the last recorded code status might be used. Null hypothesis question: Is there any relationship between medical, familial and social factors in the assignment of resuscitation code?
